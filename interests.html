            <h2>Basketball</h2>
            <p>Basketball is one of my favorite hobbies. Not only did I play basketball through all 4 years of highschool in the varsity basketball program, I also like to play with my friends on the weekends. I play the shooting guard position, and I enjoy playing basketball because it is a great form of exercise and an my oulet where I can take stressful things off my mind.</p>
